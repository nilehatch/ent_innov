## Unearthing Unmet Needs

After choosing and confirming access to a community of people, the journey of entrepreneurial innovation proceeds with a deep dive into their world. This chapter introduces the generative-leaning, exploratory experiments---our expedition into divergent thinking---needed to amass a "mountain of data" about the chosen community. It's a stage of exploration, where the primary objective is data collection, not yet interpretation or hypothesis formation.

### Gillette's Initial Approach in India: Ethnographic Insights and Strategic Decisions

Gillette's venture into the Indian market provides a compelling example of utilizing primary research to gather ethnographic data. Their approach underscores the value of in-depth, process-oriented research in innovation. It also illustrates some of the risks in experiment design that we will explore **later**.

#### Gathering Ethnographic Data

<img src="figs/Chrome-Safety-Razor.jpg" alt="So-called safety razors" class="wrapfig"/> Gillette saw opportunity in India where they had minimal market share with their existing product. They noted that most Indian men were still using "safety razors" at that time (instead of Gillette's products). Eyeing the opportunity of shavers in India, Gillette recognized the need for a deeper understanding of their potential customers' shaving habits and challenges. To accomplish this, they embarked on a primary research journey, starting with the Indian community in and around Boston.

#### The Process:

1.  **Target Group Identification**: Gillette focused on Indian men in Boston, acknowledging the diversity within this group and its relevance to their market in India.

2.  **Conducting Interviews and Observations**: The team conducted structured interviews and observational studies. These were aimed at understanding the daily shaving routines, challenges faced, and the specific needs of these men.

3.  **Contextual Understanding**: Recognizing the importance of context, Gillette's team observed shaving practices in various settings, noting differences in technique, tools used, and the overall shaving experience.

#### Strategic Decisions from Data

From this rich ethnographic data, Gillette gleaned several insights:

-   **Preference for Safety Razors**: A significant number of men preferred traditional double-edged safety razors due to their cost-effectiveness and perceived reliability.

-   **Challenges with Current Products**: Issues such as clogging and the lack of running water for rinsing were identified as significant pain points.

-   **Cultural and Contextual Nuances**: The research highlighted cultural practices and environmental factors unique to the Indian shaving experience.

Armed with these insights, Gillette realized that simply introducing their existing products into the Indian market wouldn't suffice. They needed to innovate a product tailored to these specific needs and contexts.

This phase of Gillette's innovation process illustrates the critical importance of thorough, ethnographic primary research in forming a foundation for informed decision-making and successful product development.

## Gillette's Journey in India: Part 1

Gillette's venture into the Indian market demonstrates the importance of extensive data gathering. When they first entered the market, they conducted broad primary research to understand the shaving habits and needs of Indian men. This initial exploration was about collecting as much information as possible, setting the stage for later analysis and innovation.

This part of the Gillette story exemplifies the need to cast a wide net, gathering diverse perspectives and data to build a comprehensive understanding of the community's needs.

## Case Study: Gillette in India

![Gillette's journey in India](figs/Chrome-Safety-Razor.jpg){width="50%"}

Gillette's experience in India serves as a pertinent example. Initially, Gillette misjudged the needs of Indian consumers, leading to the Vector razor's failure. The company's assumptions were challenged when they realized that their tests with Indian students in the US did not reflect the actual conditions in India, such as the lack of running water.

Learning from this, Gillette undertook extensive primary research in India, engaging directly with potential customers. This led to the development of the Guard razor, tailored to the specific needs of Indian men, such as safety and ease of cleaning without running water.

This case underscores the importance of immersive, primary research and the need to learn from initial failures. Gillette's success with the Guard razor was born out of a deeper understanding of the unmet needs of their target market.

### Beyond Direct Questions: Uncovering the Unseen

Direct inquiries about needs or problems are often less fruitful than one might expect. People's cognitive biases can obscure their ability to articulate unmet needs. Thus, our approach is to observe and study their lives, identifying the pains they've normalized. Later, we'll return to these communities to validate these observations.

### Guarding Against Bias in Innovation

As innovators, we must be vigilant against our own cognitive biases---optimism, overconfidence, and confirmation biases. These biases can skew our observations and interpretations. In this phase, strive for objectivity, aiming to collect unbiased data from your community.
